# ColinTheCleaner_Z80ASM
Colin The Cleaner - ZX Spectrum - Z80 Assembly Rewrite

This provides a Z80 assembly version of the 1987 BASIC game, Colin The Cleaner.

All code in this file was written by myself. Inspiration taken from the Spectrum Kernal ROM.

It makes use of a few helper functions from the original CODE file that came with the game, together with the character set and level data from that same file.

Other than that, it is a 100% replacement for the BASIC version.

I developed this using Notepad++, Linux Mint and its Terminal, "Z80asm" command line assembler and FUSE (the ZX Spectrum emulator).
